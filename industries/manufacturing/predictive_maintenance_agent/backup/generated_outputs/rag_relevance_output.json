However, based on the provided sample data, here's how we interpret and respond to the original question's intent:\n\n### **Direct Answer (No File Creation)**\n\n- **Unit Number(s) with RUL = 10 and dataset = 'FD004':** \n  - **Clarification Needed:** The sample data suggests a single row with `unit_number = 40` and a count of `4`. This implies either:\n    1. An error in interpreting the query's intent regarding `unit_number` and `COUNT(*)` together without a grouping clause.\n    2. The data structure or query result format is unconventional for the question asked.\n\n  - **Assuming the Intent was to Find Units with RUL = 10:**\n    - **Unit Number Found in Sample:** 40\n    - **Total Count of Such Units (as per sample):** 4\n\n    **Critical Instruction Compliance Note:** Given the unconventional result format and to adhere strictly to the critical instruction, **if** the query indeed intended to list **all** unit numbers with RUL = 10 and the dataset 'FD004', and assuming the sample might not fully represent the intent due to the aggregate function's inclusion:\n\n    - **Explicit Unit Numbers Based on Provided Sample (Limited by Query Result Format):** Only `40` is explicitly listed in the sample. \n    - **Count of Units:** 4 (implies there might be more units not listed due to the query's structure)\n\n    **Direct Answer to the Original Question's Likely Intent:**\n    - **Units with RUL = 10 and dataset 'FD004' (as directly answered from the provided sample, with a note on the query's outcome):** \n      - ** Listed Unit Number:** 40\n      - **Total Units Count (as per the ambiguous query result):** 4\n\n    **Recommendation for Clarification:**\n    - **Re-evaluate the Query** for accuracy in reflecting the intended question, possibly adjusting to either:\n      1. `SELECT unit_number FROM rul_data WHERE RUL = 10 AND dataset = 'FD004';` followed by a separate count query if needed.\n      2. Using a window function or subquery if the intent was indeed to show unit numbers with an overall count in a single query.\n\n### **No File Creation (Simple Query Interpretation)**\n\nGiven the constraints and the apparent simplicity (despite the query's potential misalignment with the question's intent), no file is created. For a more accurate response, please clarify or adjust the query as suggested.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Query Intent Might Not Align with Execution:** The query as executed doesn't clearly separate unit listings from aggregation.\n- **Provided Answer Based on Sample:**\n  - **Unit Number Explicitly Listed:** 40\n  - **Count of Units with Conditions:** 4 (interpret with caution due to query structure)\n- **Action Recommended:** Review and possibly adjust the query for clearer results alignment with the question's intent.\n\n📁 Data has been saved to: /Users/vmodak/Documents/Projects_Tutorials_Demos/PredictiveMaintenance_AIQ/GenerativeAIExamples/industries/manufacturing/predictive_maintenance_agent/output_data/input_question_in_english_sele_results.json\n📊 File contains 1 rows with columns: unit_number, COUNT(*)",
