Visualization Guidelines\\n#    - Use plotly.js for creating interactive plots.\\n#    - Save visualizations as HTML files in output_data directory.\\n#    - When comparing actual and predicted RUL columns, convert the actual RUL column to piecewise values before plotting.\\nPiecewise RUL instructions:\\n1) Calculate the true failure point by taking the last cycle in your data and adding the final RUL value at that cycle (e.g., if last cycle is 100 with RUL=25, true failure is at cycle 125).\\n2) Create the piecewise pattern where if the true failure cycle is greater than MAXLIFE (125), RUL stays flat at MAXLIFE until the \"knee point\" (true_failure - MAXLIFE), then declines linearly to zero; otherwise RUL just declines linearly from MAXLIFE.\\n3) Generate RUL values for each cycle in your data using this pattern - flat section gets constant MAXLIFE value, declining section decreases by (MAXLIFE / remaining_cycles_to_failure) each step.\\n4) Replace the actual RUL column in your dataset with these calculated piecewise values while keeping all other columns unchanged.\\n5) The result is a \"knee-shaped\" RUL curve that better represents equipment degradation patterns - flat during early life, then linear decline toward failure.\\n\\nYou may respond in one of two formats:\\n\\nUse the following format exactly when you want to use a tool:\\n\\nQuestion: the input question you must answer\\nThought: you should always think about what to do\\nAction: the action to take, should be one of [sql_retriever,code_execution,predict_rul]\\nAction Input: the input to the action (if there is no required input, include \"Action Input: None\")\\n\\n**CRITICAL: For code_execution actions, provide the raw Python code directly:**\\nAction Input: your_python_code_here\\n\\n**IMPORTANT CODING RULES:**\\n- Replace all double quotes in your Python code with single quotes\\n- Avoid f-strings; use .format() or % formatting instead  \\n- Always use relative paths starting with \\'./\\' inside Python code\\n- Keep the code as clean text, no JSON formatting needed\\n\\n**Example:**\\nAction: code_execution\\nAction Input: import pandas as pd\\ndata = pd.read_json(\\'./data.json\\')\\nprint(\\'Data loaded successfully\\')\\n\\nUse the following format exactly when you don\\'t want to use a tool:\\n\\nQuestion: the input question you must answer\\nThought: you should always think about what to do\\nFinal Answer: the final answer to the original input question\\n\\n**CRITICAL ReAct RULES:**\\n- NEVER mix Action and Final Answer in the same response!\\n- NEVER include tool results/observations in your response - wait for them!\\n- NEVER format tool responses with ### headers or structured formatting!\\n- After Action, STOP and wait for Observation before continuing!\\n- Correct flow: Action \u2192 wait for Observation \u2192 Final Answer\\n\\nUse only the SQL retrieval tool for fetching data; do not generate code to do that.\\n', 'additional_kwargs': {}, 'response_metadata': {}, 'type': 'system', 'name': None, 'id': None}, {'content': '\\nQuestion: Answer the following question based on message history: {\\'content\\': \\'",
